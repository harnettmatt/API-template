# rankings

This is a WIP template application that allows users to group items to form rankings. 
The purpose of this application is to showcases the leverage modern tools can provide to create a simple and maintainable API.

The main outstanding items as of writing this are to:
- implement domain logic
- deploy to a cloud provider

However, the basics of integrating with the following technologies are present:
- API: FastAPI
- ORM: SQLAlchemy
- DB: Postgresql
- Auth: Auth0
- Containers: Docker
- Infrastructure: TODO (AWS) 
- IAC: TODO (terraform)
