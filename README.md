This is a WIP template application that allows users to associate items to groups. I plan to build this application out to include more domain knowlege.

However, the main purpose of this application is to showcases the leverage modern tools can provide to create a simple and maintainable API that allows developers to focus on writing domain logic. In fact, Once the remaining technologies have been implemented I will convert this repo into a template repository so that it is easily extensible for future API driven projects. 

The technologies used are: 
- API: FastAPI
- ORM: SQLAlchemy
- DB: Postgresql
- Auth: Auth0
- Containers: Docker
- Infrastructure: TODO (AWS) 
- IAC: TODO (terraform)
